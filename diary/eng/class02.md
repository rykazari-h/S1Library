## 気をつけること
* have--分詞とかだと、してもらう、ヤられるイメージになる。
* get rid of--除く、ofに離れる系のイメージがある。
* lead-led-led
* 動詞、形容詞->主語や目的語を意識しよう
* 複合不定代名詞--三単現、後置修飾、no oneは特殊
* months--まんつ
## 受動態
* 彼は駅で財布を盗まれた。
1. He was robbed his wallet at the station.(受動態)
2. His wallet was stolen at the station.(主語入れ替え)
3. He had his wallet stolen at the station.(第5文型)
* 誰が盗んだのかい？
1. Who was he robbed of his wallet by?
2. By whom was he robbed of his wallet?
### 群動詞の受動態
v+形+名+前は、形+名(すなわちvの目的語)を主語にして受動態にできる。
1. He paid little attention to his child.(能動態)
2. His child was paid little attention to by him.(normal受動態)
3. Little attention was paid to his child by him.(件の受動態)
